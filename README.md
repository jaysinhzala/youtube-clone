# 📺 YouTube Clone (HTML & CSS)

A responsive **YouTube homepage clone** built using HTML5 and CSS3. This project mimics the layout and styling of YouTube’s front page — including the sidebar, video grid, thumbnails, and header — using only static code with no JavaScript.

## 🚀 Features

- 🖼️ **Video Grid Layout** – Simulates YouTube's home video feed with thumbnails, titles, and channels.
- 🧭 **Navigation Sidebar** – Responsive sidebar with icons and labels.
- 🔍 **Top Navigation Bar** – Includes logo, search box, and user icons.
- 📱 **Fully Responsive** – Works well on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Semantic structure for layout and elements
- **CSS3** – Styling, positioning, and responsive behavior

---

## 🔧 How It Works

1. The layout uses **CSS Flexbox and Grid** to create the YouTube homepage structure.
2. All thumbnails, logos, and avatars are static images stored locally.
3. There is **no JavaScript**; the focus is strictly on HTML/CSS structure and visual fidelity.
